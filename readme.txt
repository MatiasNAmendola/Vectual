How to use:

1. Copy the vectual folder into your website
2. Autoload the classes
3. Write your data into an array like you can see in example.php


Bugs in pre-alpha version:
- Tagcloud feature doesn't work at all. I'll have to rethink my algorithm.
- Toolbar feature is not implemented yet (and graph icon is missing)
- The automatic layout mode is not fully implemented yet and is pretty inaccurate.
  Currently it's a combination of automatic and custom (adjust the settings in vectual.php and vectual.css)
- No support for multidimensional charts yet
- No inline bar charts yet
- Animations not optional


If you face any more bugs please report them to me!
Thanks for your help! =)
